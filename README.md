# New_push_swap
This 42 project is about finding the less moves possible to sort a stack.
You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions
to manipulate both stacks.

The algorithm that I use not anywhere near perfect and shouldn't be used on anything serious.
This project was just a bit of fun
